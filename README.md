# ObjectNet3D_toolbox

Created by Yu Xiang at CVGL at Stanford University.

### Introduction

This is the toolbox for the [ObjectNet3D database](http://cvgl.stanford.edu/projects/objectnet3d/) introduced for 3D object recognition.
ObjectNet3D consists of 100 categories, 90,127 images, 201,888 objects in these images. 
Objects in the images in our database are aligned with the 3D shapes, 
and the alignment provides both accurate 3D pose annotation and the closest 
3D shape annotation for each 2D object.
